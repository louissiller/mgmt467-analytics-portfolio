## Course Architecture

The curriculum was structured to bridge the gap between foundational theory and real-world application through four distinct pillars:

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Practice** | High-intensity, in-class exercises focused on deep-diving into specific technical modules and learning. |
| **Assignments** | Comprehensive take-home exercises designed to reinforce weekly learning objectives. |
| **Labs** | Multi-week mini-projects that synthesize diverse skill sets into a single workflow. |
| **Final Project** | A capstone data engineering challenge involving global climate data analysis. |
